# SGUL-Exome-hg38-Pipeline-on-HPC

This is SGUL Genetic Centre's pipeline for pre-processing and variant calling of raw Exome Sequencing data.
This is a python pipeline equivalent of the GATK Best practices for Exome sequencing found here:https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-exome-analysis-pipeline/tree/master/tasks#

Joint Genotyping step is not available at the moment. Under construction :)
